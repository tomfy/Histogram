histogram.pl is a perl script for generating and plotting histograms.

It depends on Histogram.pm and Hdata.pm in this repository,
and on Graphics::GnuplotIF , available from cpan.

##########   Basic usage:   ##########

histogram.pl -i 'a_data_file:4'

This would generate and plot a histogram of the values in column 4 (the left-most column being column 1) of

the file 'a_data_file'. The histogram would display a range of values from 0 up to some upper limit. This upper limit and the bin-width would be set automatically.

You can also specify explicity any combination of the lower limit, upper limit, and bin-width
on the command line. E.g.:

histogram.pl -i 'a_data_file:4' -low -0.5 -hi 0.5 -bw 0.01

In this case there would 100 bins covering the range from 0 to 0.5. Values < 0 would be considered
'underflow' and values > 0.5 would be considered 'overflow'. The numbers of under- and over-flow values
are not shown graphically but are included in the tabular representation of the histograms which is also
output.

If the upper limit or bin-width is not specified on the command line it will be set automatically.
By specifying  -low auto , the lower limit can also be set automatically.

Multiple histograms can be displayed on the same plot. E.g.:

histogram.pl -i 'a_data_file:4,11'

would display 2 histograms, one with col. 4 data, and the other with col. 11 data.

In addition to being plotted, the histograms are output in text form as a table giving for each bin
the limits of the bin, and the number of counts of each histogram in the bin, as well as the
cumulative counts in all bins up to and including that bin, and including the underflow.

##########   Modifying the plot   ###########

If, upon viewing the plot, you don't like the binning, or the range of values shown, you can modify
these and other parameters:

First close the window displaying the plot with q<enter>.

Then, for example:
bw:0.001<enter>   set the bin-width to 0.001

lo:-0.2<enter>    set the lower limit of the histograms to -0.2

hi:10<enter>	  set the upper limit of the histograms to 10

Changing any of these parameters causes the binning of the data points to be repeated with
the new parameter values.

The maximum y-value of the plot can be set, e.g.:
ymax:100<enter>
(There are actually separate ymax values for linear and log scales; this command sets the one corresponding to the type of plot presently displayed.
So if you set ymax while the scale is linear, the ymax that will be used for log scale is not affected.)

Instead of explicitly specifying a new bin-width, you can use 'r' (refine) or 'c' (coarsen).
A new bin-width from the set   ..., 0.08, 0.1, 0.125, 0.2, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, ...
r<enter>   	  refine by one step
r:3<enter> 	  refine by 3 steps
c:2<enter>	  coarsen by 2 steps

You can toggle between linear and logarithmic vertical scales like this:
ll<enter>

You can label the x-axis:
xlabel:'mass (kg)'<enter>

You can also combine two or more of these modifying commands on one line by separating with ';'. E.g.:

r:3;hi:0.3;ll<enter>

##########

You can plot multiple histograms of data from different files:
histogram.pl -i 'a_file:4,5;another_file:7;yet_another_file:3'


You can histogram the sum of 2 or more columns:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:4+5'
histogram.pl -i 'a_file:11+4+5'

You can also subtract rather than add values from some columns:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:8-9+3'

(However no sign is allowed in front of the first column specified.)


To histogram the quotient of two columns:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:10/3'


To include in one histogram all of the values in 2 or more columns use 'u' (for 'union'):

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:3u5u7'

##########   labels   ##########

By default the plot will have a key with labels for each histogram based on the specification
of file, columns, operations, etc. on the command line. E.g.:
histogram.pl -i 'a_file:4+5;another_file:8-10'
would have 'a_file:4+5'  as one label, and 'another_file:8-10' as the other label.

However we can specify labels on the command line by putting the desired label text in double quotes. E.g.:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:4+5"hamsters";another_file:4+5"gerbils"'


##########   exporting a png   ##########
You can export to a png file:

export:'mass_distribution'<enter>

This will created a file 'mass_distribution.png' containing the histogram plot.

##########   general gnuplot commands   ##########
You can modify the plot with other gnuplot commands. For example:

cmd:'set grid'<enter>
cmd:'set key left'<enter>
