histogram.pl is a perl script for generating and plotting histograms.

It depends on Histogram.pm and Hdata.pm in this repository,
and on Graphics::GnuplotIF , available from cpan.

##########   Basic usage:   ##########

histogram.pl -i 'a_data_file:4'

This would generate and plot a histogram of the values in column 4 (unit based) of
the file 'a_data_file'. Lower & upper bounds and the bin-width would be set automatically.

You can also specify explicity any combination of the lower bound, upper bound, and bin-width
on the command line. E.g.:

histogram.pl -i 'a_data_file:4' -low 0 -hi 0.5 -bw 0.005

In this case there would 100 bins covering the range from 0 to 0.5. Values < 0 would be considered
'underflow' and values > 0.5 would be considered 'overflow'. The numbers of under- and over-flow values
are not shown graphically but are included in the tabular representation of the histograms which is also
output.

Whichever of these parameters are not specified on the command line will be set automatically.

Muliple histograms can be displayed on the same plot. E.g.:

histogram.pl -i 'a_data_file:4,11'

would display 2 histograms, one with col. 4 data, and the other with col. 11 data.

In addition to being plotted, the histograms are output in text form as a table giving for each bin
the limits of the bin, and the number of counts of each histogram in the bin, as well as the
cumulative counts in all bins up to and including that bin, and including the underflow.

##########   Modifying the plot   ###########

If, upon viewing the plot, you don't like the binning, or the range of values shown, you can modify
these and other parameters:

First close the window displaying the plot with q<enter>.

Then, for example:
bw:0.001<enter>   set the bin-width to 0.001

lo:-0.2<enter>    set the lower limit of the histograms to -0.2

hi:10<enter>	  set the upper limit of the histograms to 10

Changing any of these parameters causes the binning of the data points to be repeated with
the new parameter values.

Instead of explicitly specifying a new bin-width, you can use 'r' (refine) or 'c' (coarsen). E.g.:
r<enter>   	  refine by one unit
r:3<enter> 	  refine by 3 units 
c:2<enter>	  coarsen by 2 units

You can toggle between linear and logarithmic vertical scales like this:
ll<enter>

You can label the x-axis:
xlabel:'mass (kg)'<enter>

You can also combine two or more of these modifying commands on one line by separating with ';'. E.g.:

r:3;hi:0.3;ll<enter>

##########

You can plot multiple histograms of data from different files:
histogram.pl -i 'a_file:4,5;another_file:7;yet_another_file:3'


You can histogram the sum of 2 or more columns:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:4+5'
histogram.pl -i 'a_file:11+4+5'

You can also subtract rather than add values from some columns:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:8-9+3'

(However no sign is allowed in front of the first column specified.)


To histogram the quotient of two columns:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:10/3'


To histogram the union of the sets of values in 2 or more columns:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:3u5u7'

##########   labels   ##########

By default the plot will have a key with labels for each histogram based on the specification
of file, columns, operations, etc. on the command line. E.g.:
histogram.pl -i 'a_file:4+5;another_file:8-10'
would have 'a_file:4+5'  as one label, and 'another_file:8-10' as the other label.

However we can specify labels on the command line by putting the desired label text in double quotes. E.g.:

histogram.pl -i 'a_file:4+5"hamsters";another_file:4+5"gerbils"'


##########   exporting   ##########
You can export to a png file:

export:'mass_distribution'<enter>

This will created a file 'mass_distribution.png' containing the histogram plot.
